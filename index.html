    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <img src="images/chris.JPG">

    <p>Emmorton Snowballs and Ice Cream is a second generation family business. It was founded by Ms. Chris in June of 1981, and today is run by Ms. Chris&rsquo; son, Neil.</p>

    <p>Emmorton Snowballs and Ice Cream was named for the small town of Emmorton, near the crossroads of Emmorton Road and Wheel Road. Today, this area is generally considered a part of Bel Air, but a few businesses and sports teams continue to use the Emmorton name. We share the property of the former Emmorton Elementary School, which was completed in 1930, and is used today as doctors&rsquo; offices.</p>

    <p>We started out as a small snowball stand, and Ms. Chris spent many long days sitting and waiting for the occasional customer. Dedicated to a business that she knew could succeed, she spent years focusing on quality products and friendly service to build a strong reputation.</p>

    <p>By 1988, business had grown enough to warrant expansion beyond the original tiny building. A new building, almost twice as large as the first, was erected on site, to replace the original and allow room for a second customer service window.</p>

    <p>In 2001, the decision was made to start selling ice cream, and another new building had to be constructed to handle the necessary upgrades. The 1988 building was moved to the side and today is used as a &lsquo;snowballs only&rsquo; customer service area that is opened only during peak hours to help minimize customer wait times.</p>

    <p>Today we strive to continue our tradition of excellent products combined with quality customer service. Thank you for helping to make Emmorton Snowballs a Harford County tradition for 30 years and counting!</p>
